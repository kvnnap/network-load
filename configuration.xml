	<!-- Messaging Methods:
        0 (depr) = Every node sends to each other node in the beginning, then all reads are performed afterwords
        1 (depr) = Every node takes a turn and will send all messages in the random order they were gotten, while
            other nodes receive until it is their turn to send
        2 (depr) = Every node takes a turn and will send all messages to each node individually, depending on the
                send count, while other nodes receive until it is their turn to send
        3 = Every node has a global state of messages to be sent/received to itself. Therefore each message sent
            will have a matching receive
        4 = Same as 3, but message operations are shuffled before being made global
